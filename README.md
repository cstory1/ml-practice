# Machine Learning Practice 🚀

This repository documents my **Machine Learning learning journey**, where I practice core ML concepts using Python, real datasets, and hands-on experiments.

The goal of this repo is simple:
**learn by doing**, understand ML fundamentals deeply, and gradually build confidence through practical examples.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

* Practicing Machine Learning concepts step by step
* Applying ML to real-world datasets
* Understanding **how models work**, not just running code
* Tracking my progress as I learn and improve

This is a **learning repository**, so expect experiments, iterations, and improvements over time.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## 📁 Projects & Files

### 📊 Student Performance Analysis

**Files:**

* `student_performance_analysis.py`
* `StudentPerformance.csv`

**Objective:**
Analyze student performance data and understand how different factors affect academic results.

**Concepts Practiced:**

* Data loading & cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection
* Linear regression
* Model evaluation

**Key Learnings:**

* How input features influence predictions
* Importance of clean, structured data
* Evaluating model performance using metrics

---

### 📈 Polynomial Regression

**File:**

* `polynomial_regression.py`

**Objective:**
Understand non-linear relationships in data using polynomial regression.

**Concepts Practiced:**

* Polynomial feature transformation
* Overfitting vs underfitting
* Model comparison

**Key Learnings:**

* Linear models can be extended to handle non-linear data
* Higher-degree models can easily overfit
* Visualization is crucial for understanding model behavior
